# Job Finder



## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Job Finder applicatiion.

Before we get started with dart and flutter, we first need to set up our programming environment, which is what we will be using to code flutter apps.

The two main IDEs that provide the most features for Dart and Flutter are Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Android Studio. Choosing either one is up to you, but I do have a slight preference to VS Code because it looks sick...

Vim can also be used if you have coc or native lsp and install the dart and flutter extensions.

Choosing the right IDE is essential to getting all the features that the Dart programming language provides us with. Once you have your IDE / Text Editor, make sure you install the Dart extension and the Flutter extension. With these extensions, our IDE / Text Editor will perform extremely detailed error checking, type checking, null safety checks, and formatting to make our lives as developers a lot easier.

Once you have your environment set up, let's move on!

## There are many ways to run any flutter project available on github , one of them is through the following steps :

1.Open the Github project repository which you want to run on your VsCode.  
2.On the top right corner Fork the project and after that click on the green button representing to download the code.  
3.Now copy the Project Link URL.  
4.Now open the console palette in VsCode and type Git clone on the console palette.  
5.After that paste the project Link URL and press Enter , Select the folder where you want to save the project and now open the project in VsCode.  
6.After all the packages are loaded in VsCode , connect the device and type the command Flutter Run on your terminal and wait for the App to install.
